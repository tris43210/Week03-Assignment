Refelection:

Things I learnt creting the webiste:

Using the overflow hidden property
Utilising CSS grid in conjunction with flexbox to create a responsive layout
parsing objects into local storage to use in applications and using the set interval function.
Using the animation and @keyframes to create a spinning motion on images.

Things I found easier:

- First and foremost I have now found using For Each a lot easier than last week. This is mainly from learning each of the parameters it takes and how I can use those to access different parts of objects within an Array.

Things I found more difficult:

- I had some trouble once I had done some research on getting the cookie to spin. I found the @keyframes property but once I had set it all up it was causing the page to scroll on evrey spin. After a lot of trial and error I found the overflow hidden property that stopped it interacting with the other elements on the page stopping the scrolling from occuring.
- Jumping around code: I found myself coding alot of the functionality within Javascript rather quickly. This lead to probelms later down the line as I needed to go back to sections a 'patch' particular issues leading to messy code.
